# Simple Discord Bot for user Verification

has 2 slash commands ("/setup" and "/info")

uses discord.js and REST to work with discord api


## Setup Instrucitions

run: npm install discord.js @discordjs/builders @discordjs/rest discord-api-types/v9

Replace "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN", "YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID", and optionally "YOUR_SERVER_ID" with your actual bot credentials


## Things better to add to keep on using this source:

    1. Database: For a real bot, replace the in-memory storage with a proper database like MongoDB or SQLite

    2. Error Handling: Add more comprehensive error handling

    3. Logging: Add logging for verification events
